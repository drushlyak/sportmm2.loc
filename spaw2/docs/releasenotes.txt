SPAW Editor PHP Edition
Version 2.0.7

2.0.7 Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

The main focus of this release was reworking of the style application algorithm
combining good parts of the ways this was done in SPAW 1.x and SPAW 2 and
getting rid of the bad. Other bus were fixed, workarounds impemented and new
features added.

Numerous language files were updated and fixed by the community. Thanks! 

For a complete list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes some language files that were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
